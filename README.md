# Description

Throughout the completion of the REST API project, I gained valuable experience in interpreting functional descriptions and specifications to fulfill the assignment requirements. By breaking the project into manageable components, I was able to effectively tackle each task and ensure a cohesive outcome. Working with Node.js, JavaScript, and Fastify, I sharpened my skills in writing and executing non-web server code, as well as creating and using code modules.

One of the initial steps involved creating project files and initializing the Node project file. By adding Fastify, a popular web framework, I was able to efficiently handle the GET verb and define routes and route parameters. This allowed me to respond to various API requests effectively.

The project relied on a data source file, "p4-data.js," which contained an array of questions and answers. The module.exports statement was carefully placed below the array declaration to avoid hoisting issues. I learned the significance of the array declaration order in relation to JavaScript's hoisting behavior.

To access the data file within the code module, "p4-module.js," I utilized the require statement, ensuring that the data was imported correctly. The code module consisted of six functions that performed various operations on the data, such as retrieving questions, answers, or both, based on specific requirements.

Throughout the development process, I diligently tested each function using the provided testing code. By examining the output, I could verify that the functions produced the expected results. The testing code included various scenarios, including error handling and extra credit functionalities.

Reflecting on the project, I appreciate the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in working with REST APIs, handling static data, and testing code modules without relying on a web server. This allowed me to understand the core concepts and practice implementing them effectively.

Additionally, the project offered extra credit opportunities, such as deep cloning the data, handling potential bad or missing data, and coding additional functionalities using the POST, PUT, and DELETE verbs. While I initially focused on completing the required elements, I found it beneficial to explore the extra credit options as well. It challenged me to think beyond the basic requirements and extend the functionality of the REST API.

To conclude, completing this REST API project provided me with valuable insights into creating and utilizing code modules, working with JSON data, testing code effectively, and building a functional REST API server. By following the project's guidelines and testing the functionalities rigorously, I was able to enhance my proficiency in Node.js, JavaScript, and API development.
